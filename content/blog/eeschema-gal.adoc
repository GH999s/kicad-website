The KiCad project recently merged the Eeschema modern canvas code into
the development branch.  This represents a significant change in the way
the schematics and symbols are rendered by using the same modern canvas
code used in Pcbnew.  The schematic and symbol editing tools will not
use the advanced tool framework used in Pcbnew so there will be no new
editing features such as advanced selection, snapping, etc.  The advanced
tool framework features will be introduced into Eeschema during version 6
development.

This will be one of the last major code changes before the stable 5.1
release feature freeze so please help test it so we can get the stable
5.1 release out as soon as possible.  Thank you for your patience during
this transition.
