The KiCad project is proud of our roll as the electronic design application
use by the https://gitlab.com/openventilator[Open Ventilator] project.
The Open Ventilator project is based on a release of the Medtronic PB560
ventilator mentioned in
https://makezine.com/2020/04/02/kicad-medtronic-pb560-ventilator-schematics/[this Maker article].
Even though the ventilator shortage never materialized in most parts of the
world, the Open Ventilator project clearly demonstrates the potential of
open hardware.  The project was started by KiCad lead developer Seth
Hillbrand early in the COVID-19 pandemic.  It quickly gain dozens of
contributors from all over the world.  The project has progressed to the
point where prototypes have been ordered and are currently being evaluated.
Once the design is finalized, there will be permanent open ventilator design
resource for future needs as they arise.  KiCad hopes to continue to push
the benefits of open hardware designs into many other areas.  Like open
software designs, there is no limit to what is possible with open hardware
designs.
